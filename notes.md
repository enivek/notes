# Math Three-Stage Format

Your answer must be in a three-stage format, "Solution", "Proof", and "Final Answer". 
The solution and proof stage must have steps numbered from 1 to *n*. 
Each step must either have an operation or a mathematical rule used (referenced by page number or something like that). 
Also, you can only use one operation in each step. An operation is any one of the following: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, or power operation.

The final answer stage must have the final answer, and any applicable units.

## Evaluate an Expression

When performing an evaluate an expression math question, prove your solution is correct by showing that the solution can betraced back to the original question in reverse.

**Example #1: Evaluate an Expression**

Question: Evaluate the following expression: 17 - (2 x 3)^2

Solution:
1. 17 - (2 x 3)^2    original question
2. 17 - (6)^2        multiplication
3. 17 - 6^2          removed parenthesis
4. 17 - 36           power
5. -19               subtration

Proof:
1. -19               original answer 
2. 17 - 36           subtraction
3. 17 - 6^2          power
4. 17 - (6)^2        added parenthesis
5. 17 - (2 x 3)^2    multiplication. 

Final Answer: -19

**Example #2: Evaluate an Expression**

Question: Evaluate the following expression: (5.33 x 10^6) ^ -6

Solution:
1. (5.33 x 10^6) ^ -6   original question.
2. 5.33^-6 x 10^-36     page 29

Proof:
1. 5.33^-6 x 10^-36     original answer
2. (5.33 x 10^6)^-6     page 29

Final Answer: 5.33^-6 x 10^-36 

## Word Problems

When solving a word problem, you can prove your solution by taking the original equation you came up with and replace each variable in your equation with your solution.

**Example #1: Word problem**

Question: A certain restaurant has 420 tables. If they add 63 additional tables, what is the percentage increase?

Solution:
1. 420 * p/100 + 420 = 483     definition of percentage increase
2. 420 * p/100 = 63            subtract 420 from both sides
3. p/100 = 63/420              divide both sides by 420
4. p = 63 * 100/420            multiply both sides by 100
5. p = 6300/420                multiply
6. 15                          divide

Proof:
1. 420 * 15/100 + 420 = 483    original answer, substituted the variable p.
2. 420 * 0.15 + 420 = 483      division
3. 63 + 420 = 483              multiplication
4. 483 = 483                   addition

Final answer: 15%

Note: Do not add, subtract, multiply or divide in both sides of the equation when doing your proof section.

**Example #2: Word problem**

Question: John's pay is proportional to the number of hours he works. John makes $34 in 4 hours. How much will he earn in 7 hours?

Solution:
1. 34/4 = ?/7      ratio and proportion
2. 34*7/4 = ?      multiply both sides by 7
3. 8.5*7 = ?       division
4. 59.5 = ?        multiplication

Proof:
1. 34/4 = 59.5/7   original answer
2. 8.5 = 59.5/7    division
3. 8.5 = 8.5       division

Final answer: $59.5 

Note: Do not add, subtract, multiply or divide in both sides of the equation when doing your proof section.

## Solve for X problems

Very similar to word problems. Provide a solution and proof. Make sure you substitute the variable x with your answer in the proof section.

**Example #1: Solve for X problem**

Question: 3/x + 1/2 = 5/(x-1)

Solution:
1. 3/x + 1/2 = 5/(x-1)           original question
2. 3*(x-1)/x + (x-1)/2 = 5       multiply by (x-1) on both sides
3. 3*(x-1) + x*(x-1)/2 = 5*x     multiply by x on both sides
4. 2*3*(x-1) + x*(x-1) = 2*5*x   multiply by 2 on both sides
5. 6*(x-1) + x*(x-1) = 2*5*x     multiply
6. 6*(x-1) + x*(x-1) = 10*x      multiply
7. 6*(x-1) + x^2 - x = 10*x      distributive property 
8. 6*x - 6 + x^2 - x = 10*x      distributive property
9. -4*x - 6 + x^2 - x = 0        subtract 10*x on both sides
10. -5*x - 6 + x^2 = 0           subtraction
11. (x + 1)(x - 6) = 0           factoring
12. (x + 1) = 0                  one of the factors is 0
13. x = -1                       subtraction
14. (x - 6) = 0                  one of the factors is 0
15. x = 6                        addition

Proof:
1. 3/(-1) + 1/2 = 5/(-1-1)       original question with x = -1
2. -3 + 1/2 = 5/(-1-1)           division
3. -3 + 1/2 = 5/(-2)             subtraction
4. -2 1/2 = 5/(-2)               subtraction
5. -2 1/2 = -2 1/2               subtraction
1. 3/(6) + 1/2 = 5/(6-1)         original question with x = 6
2. 1/2 + 1/2 = 5/(6-1)           division
3. 1/2 + 1/2 = 5/(5)             subtraction
4. 1 = 5/(5)                     addition
5. 1 = 1                         division

Final answer: x = 6 or x = -1

Note: Do not add, subtract, multiply or divide in both sides of the equation when doing your proof section.
