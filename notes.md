# Math Two-Stage Format

Your answer must be in a two-stage format, "Solution" and "Proof". Each stage has steps numbered from 1 to *n*. 
Each step must either have an operation or a mathematical rule used (referenced by page number or something like that). 
Also, you can only use one operation in each step. An operation is any one of the following: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, or power operation.

## Evaluate an Expression

When performing an evaluate an expression math question, prove your solution is correct by showing that the solution can betraced back to the original question in reverse.

**Example #1: Evaluate an Expression**

Question: Evaluate the following expression: 17 - (2 x 3)^2

Solution:
1. 17 - (2 x 3)^2    original question
2. 17 - (6)^2        multiplication
3. 17 - 6^2          removed parenthesis
4. 17 - 36           power
5. -19               subtration

Proof:
1. -19               original answer 
2. 17 - 36           subtraction
3. 17 - 6^2          power
4. 17 - (6)^2        added parenthesis
5. 17 - (2 x 3)^2    multiplication. 

**Example #2: Evaluate an Expression**

Question: Evaluate the following expression: (5.33 x 10^6) ^ -6

Solution:
1. (5.33 x 10^6) ^ -6   original question.
2. 5.33^-6 x 10^-36     page 29

Proof:
1. 5.33^-6 x 10^-36     original answer
2. (5.33 x 10^6)^-6     page 29

## Word Problems

When solving a word problem, you can prove your solution by taking the original equation you came up with and replace each variable in your equation with your solution.

**Example #1: Word problem**

Question: A certain restaurant has 420 tables. If they add 63 additional tables, what is the percentage increase?

Solution:
1. 420 * p/100 + 420 = 483     definition of percentage increase
2. 420 * p/100 = 63            subtract 420 from both sides
3. p/100 = 63/420              divide both sides by 420
4. p = 63 * 100/420            multiply both sides by 100
5. p = 6300/420                multiply
6. 15                          divide

Proof:
1. 420 * 15/100 + 420 = 483    original answer, substituted the variable p.
2. 420 * 0.15 + 420 = 483      division
3. 63 + 420 = 483              multiplication
4. 483 = 483                   addition

**Example #2: Word problem**

Question: John's pay is proportional to the number of hours he works. John makes $34 in 4 hours. How much will he earn in 7 hours?

Solution:
1. 34/4 = ?/7      ratio and proportion
2. 34*7/4 = ?      multiply both sides by 7
3. 8.5*7 = ?       division
4. 59.5 = ?        multiplication

Proof:
1. 34/4 = 59.5/7   original answer
2. 8.5 = 59.5/7    division
3. 8.5 = 8.5       division
